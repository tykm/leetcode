Goal: Tyler will attempt to accomplish this list in 5 weeks. Average of 10 problems per week. 

Potential Problems: The first two weeks are easy, but the difficulty ramps up exponentially. I think when I reach the heaps & trees section I will have trouble and need to put more time into it.

Solution: I can frontload the work. Try to do 2 weeks of problems in 1.5 weeks.
